<div class="myDiv">
<p>Mixology is nothing new. Bartenders have been making craft cocktails for over a hundred years, according to Jared Preston Hirsch, a mixologist and owner of <q>NickelDime</q> LLC, a business devoted to making syrups for craft cocktails. With the rise of new distillation methods and bar culture in America’s big port cities came the concept of making individual “designer drinks” for patrons, combining local ingredients into custom beverages and experimenting with taste and flavor combinations.</p>
